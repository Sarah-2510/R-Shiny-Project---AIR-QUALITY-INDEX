# R-Shiny-Project---AIR-QUALITY INDEX-

## Data 
### Link To The Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india 
The dataset was taken from Kaggle. It is publicly available by the Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) which is the official portal of the Government of India

### Data Description 
The dataset consisted of approximately 30,000 rows with data for 26 cities and 12
different pollutants contributing to the air quality Index (AQI) over a time span of 5
years i.e;2015-2020.

### Pre-Processing
The time period chosen was 2017-2019. Then, the cities with the highest variation in AQI levels 
were filtered out. The missing values were treated using linear interpolation. About 8540 rows and 14 columns
were left after the pre-processing of the data.

## Pre-requisites
Install all of the libraries listed in the Requirements.txt file.

## Introduction 

### What is Air Quality Index ? 
The Air Quality Index is a scale designed to convey the current state of air quality to people in
easily comprehensible terms. It converts the complex air quality data of different pollutants into a
numerical value (index value), terminology and colour. The main objective of the AQI is to
inform and caution the public about the risk of exposure to daily pollution levels.

### Project Goal
The project aimed at analysing Air Quality Data for various cities in India over a time
period of 2017-2019. The project analyses the same data in multiple ways using different
statistical tools and visualization tools to derive insights from the changing trends over
years.

## Conclusion 
Through these graphs and statistical tools, it was seen how AQI has changed over the 
course of years and which pollutant is the most significant contributor to a given city. In nearly all the 8
cities that were  analysed, the quality of air was low.
